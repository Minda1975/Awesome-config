# Awesome wm-config

My personal Awesome window manager configuration files. It's almost default config, but with [Vicious](https://github.com/vicious-widgets/vicious) (widgets for Cpu usage, Mem usage, uptime, Mpd, os type, net usage) and [Awesome-Revelation - Mac OSX like 'Expose' view of all clients](https://github.com/guotsuan/awesome-revelation)

In order for this configuration to work, you need to follow the instructions written [here](https://github.com/guotsuan/awesome-revelation)
